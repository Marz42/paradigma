# Symptom

`pd-compact-progress.py` raised a Python `SyntaxError` when the f-string contained a backslash before the closing brace.

# Impact

The compact progress tool could not run in write mode until the escaping was fixed. The dry-run output path was unaffected because the bug was in the `--write` code path where a backslash-escaped pipe character appeared inside the f-string expression.

# Root Cause

Python f-strings do not allow bare backslashes inside `{...}` expressions. The code attempted `signal.replace("|", "\\|")` directly inside the f-string.

# Workaround

Precompute the escaped value before the f-string:

```
escaped_signal = signal.replace("|", "\\|")
lines.append(f"| " + f"[{rel}]" + f"({rel})" + " | " + title + " | " + escaped_signal + " |")
```

# Permanent Fix

Applied in the hardening session (2026-07-04). The precomputed variable pattern should be used for any f-string expression that requires backslash escaping.
