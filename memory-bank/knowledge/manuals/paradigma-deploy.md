# Purpose

This manual records Paradigma-specific release preparation steps. It is **not** a general-purpose deploy guide for derived projects — it documents how the Paradigma repository itself reaches a releasable state. Derived projects should write their own deploy manual under `manuals/`.

# Preconditions

- The repository has an initialized `memory-bank/` structure.
- Tooling commands are run from the repository root.
- Production credentials or secrets are never stored in Memory-Bank files.

# Steps

1. Run OKF lint and link checks.
2. Sync indexes after knowledge changes.
3. Update `VERSION`, changelog, ADRs, and progress logs when required.
4. Review generated blocks and untracked files before release.

# Verification

- `python .paradigma/tools/pd-lint-okf.py --strict`
- `python .paradigma/tools/pd-check-links.py`
- `python .paradigma/tools/pd-sync-index.py --check`
- `python .paradigma/tools/pd-check-hot-size.py`

# Rollback

If a release preparation step produces incorrect generated content, restore the affected generated block by rerunning the relevant tool after fixing the source concept document. Do not rewrite historical changelog entries; add a corrective entry in the next release.

# Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Strict lint fails | Missing frontmatter field or section | Add the required field/section according to schema |
| Link check fails | Moved document or stale relation | Update the link or relation target |
| Index check fails | Concept changed after index generation | Run `pd-sync-index.py --write` |
