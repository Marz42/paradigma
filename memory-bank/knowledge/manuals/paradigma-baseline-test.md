# Purpose

This guide defines the local validation sequence for Paradigma changes. It is **not** a general-purpose testing guide for derived projects — it documents the baseline quality gates that the Paradigma repository itself must pass. Derived projects should write their own testing guide under `manuals/`.

# Preconditions

- Run commands from the repository root.
- Use Python 3.11+ or another Python 3 version compatible with standard-library type syntax used by the tools.
- Set `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` when running validation if you want to avoid local `__pycache__` files.

# Steps

1. Run the standard-library unittest suite before and after tool refactors.
2. Run version consistency checks after release, config, OKF, or document schema changes.
3. Run strict OKF lint after concept or schema edits.
4. Run link checks after Markdown links, relations, or index entries change.
5. Run index sync in `--check` mode before deciding whether to write generated blocks.
6. Run hot-size checks before ending substantial sessions.
7. Compile Python tools when their implementation changes.

# Verification

Recommended command sequence:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v
python .paradigma/tools/pd-check-all.py
```

Individual tools can also be run separately:

# Rollback

Validation tools should not delete source content. If a generated index update is wrong, fix the source frontmatter or relations and rerun `pd-sync-index.py --write`.

# Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Version check fails | Distribution, installed, config, OKF, or document schema metadata drifted | Run `pd-version.py --verbose --check` and update only the field whose semantic version changed |
| `unknown type` | Schema registry missing the concept type | Add the type to `.paradigma/schemas/paradigma-types.schema.yaml` |
| Timestamp error | Non-ISO frontmatter timestamp | Use `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss+08:00` |
| Link check reports a planned relation | The target is intentionally future work | Keep it under `paradigma.relations.planned` |
