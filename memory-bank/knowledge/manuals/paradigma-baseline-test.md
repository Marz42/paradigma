# Purpose

This guide defines the local validation sequence for Paradigma changes. It is **not** a general-purpose testing guide for derived projects — it documents the baseline quality gates that the Paradigma repository itself must pass. Derived projects should write their own testing guide under `manuals/`.

# Preconditions

- Run commands from the repository root.
- Use Python 3.11+; install `requirements.txt`, then install the local package with `python -m pip install --no-deps .`.
- Set `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` when running validation if you want to avoid local `__pycache__` files.

# Steps

1. Run the standard-library unittest suite before and after tool refactors.
2. Run version consistency checks after release, config, OKF, or document schema changes.
3. Run strict OKF lint after concept or schema edits.
4. Run link checks after Markdown links, relations, or index entries change.
5. Run `pd-index.py rebuild` after concept metadata changes, then run `pd-index.py verify`.
6. Run hot-size checks before ending substantial sessions.
7. Compile Python tools when their implementation changes.
8. Run archive tests after changing task state, templates, mutation planning, atomic writes, or retry behavior.
9. Build a wheel and import it from an isolated target after package metadata or `src/paradigma/` changes.

# Characterization Matrix

| Surface | Preserved baseline |
|---------|--------------------|
| lint | Repository success; YAML diagnostics; strict timestamp, required-field, required-section, and generated-checksum failures |
| link check | Repository success; visible missing targets fail; planned relations warn; code-region links are ignored |
| index | Root/local/cache boundary; deterministic rebuild; corruption detection; atomic replace failure; legacy wrapper compatibility |
| hot-size | Repository success; exact task state validation; warning/error thresholds; `--fail-on-warn` exit behavior |
| archive | Default dry-run; strict status; source conflict; atomic create/replace; interruption recovery; idempotent retry |
| compact | Dry-run does not write; source logs are preserved; invalid YAML and atomic replace failure preserve the old summary |
| diagnose | Self-diagnosis success; legacy version migration; unknown workspace JSON and exit code 2 |
| version | Five version dimensions; legacy-field rejection; distribution drift; invalid SemVer |
| check-all | Repository success; default first-failure stop; `--keep-going` failure aggregation |

The suite also relocates the harness into a temporary derived workspace, rebuilds its cache, and runs the aggregate quality gate there. Mutation and failure-injection tests never write into the working repository.

# Verification

Recommended command sequence:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install --no-deps .
pd index rebuild
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v
pd check --dry-run
```

Individual tools can also be run separately:

```powershell
python -m unittest tests.characterization.test_tools -v
python -m unittest tests.characterization.test_failure_baselines -v
pd version --format json
pd index verify --format json
pd diagnose --project . --upstream . --format json
python .paradigma/tools/pd-check-all.py --keep-going  # compatibility only
```

# Rollback

Validation tools should not delete source content. If a local or machine index is wrong, fix canonical frontmatter/relations and rerun `pd-index.py rebuild`; deleting `.paradigma/cache/` is always safe.

# Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Version check fails | Distribution, installed, config, OKF, or document schema metadata drifted | Run `pd-version.py --verbose --check` and update only the field whose semantic version changed |
| `unknown type` | Schema registry missing the concept type | Add the type to `.paradigma/schemas/paradigma-types.schema.yaml` |
| Timestamp error | Non-ISO frontmatter timestamp | Use `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss+08:00` |
| `YAML_SYNTAX_ERROR` / `YAML_DUPLICATE_KEY` | Invalid YAML or an ambiguous repeated key | Fix the reported source line; do not suppress the parser diagnostic |
| `ENCODING_ERROR` | File is not valid UTF-8 | Re-save as UTF-8 (UTF-8 BOM is accepted) |
| `PD_ARCHIVE_INVALID_STATUS` | `Current Status` is prose, punctuated, empty, or unknown | Use exactly one of `pending`, `active`, `blocked`, `completed`, `aborted` |
| `PD_ARCHIVE_SOURCE_CHANGED` | active-task changed after dry-run plan generation | Generate and review a fresh plan; do not force the stale plan |
| Archive exists but active-task was not reset | Process stopped between the two atomic writes | Re-run `pd-archive-task.py --write`; it reuses the same `archive_id` |
| Machine cache missing or stale | Cache was deleted/corrupted or source metadata changed | Run `pd-index.py rebuild`, then `pd-index.py verify` |
| Root index starts growing with every concept | Recursive generated block was reintroduced | Remove it with rebuild and keep only high-level human navigation |
| `PD_COMPACT_IO_ERROR` | Summary temp write, flush, or atomic replace failed | Fix the filesystem issue and retry; the prior summary and all source logs remain unchanged |
| Link check reports a planned relation | The target is intentionally future work | Keep it under `paradigma.relations.planned` |
