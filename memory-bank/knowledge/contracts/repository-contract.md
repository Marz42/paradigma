# Scope

This contract defines the externally meaningful repository boundaries for Project Paradigma. The project is currently a documentation/template/tooling repository, not an application runtime.

# Contract

## Repository Layout

| Area | Contract |
|------|----------|
| `memory-bank/runtime/` | Ephemeral Agent state; not exported as OKF knowledge |
| `memory-bank/logs/` | Operational logs and changelog; append-first history |
| `memory-bank/knowledge/` | OKF-compatible long-lived knowledge bundle |
| `docs/rfc/` | OKF-compatible proposal/RFC documents |
| `memory-bank-template/` | Blank templates for derived projects |
| `.paradigma/tools/` | Deterministic local tooling |

## Tool Commands

| Command | Status | Contract |
|---------|--------|----------|
| `python .paradigma/tools/pd-check-all.py` | Stable | Aggregates lint, link check, index check, and hot-size into a single quality gate |
| `python .paradigma/tools/pd-lint-okf.py --strict` | Stable | Checks concept documents against schema, sections, timestamps, policies, and generated blocks |
| `python .paradigma/tools/pd-check-links.py` | Stable | Checks Markdown links, frontmatter relations, and generated index entries |
| `python .paradigma/tools/pd-sync-index.py --write` | Stable | Scans concepts and updates root and subdirectory generated index blocks |
| `python .paradigma/tools/pd-check-hot-size.py` | Stable | Reports active-task, HOT knowledge, and progress index size status |
| `python .paradigma/tools/pd-archive-task.py --write` | Stable | Archives completed active task into session logs and resets active task |
| `python .paradigma/tools/pd-compact-progress.py --write` | Stable | Writes a compact progress summary without deleting source logs |

# Request Schema

No HTTP, SDK, or CLI request schema is currently published. Tool command arguments are intentionally minimal and documented in each script help text.

# Response Schema

Tooling uses process exit codes:

| Exit code | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Validation failed |

# State Transitions

```text
User request -> runtime active task -> knowledge routing -> edits -> lint -> logs/knowledge update
```

# Compatibility Notes

- Adding new optional frontmatter fields is backward compatible.
- Adding new Paradigma concept types is backward compatible if existing types remain valid.
- Moving core paths such as `memory-bank/knowledge/` or changing required tooling commands is a compatibility-impacting protocol change and requires version evaluation.

# Breaking Change Policy

Breaking repository protocol changes require explicit user confirmation and SemVer evaluation under `memory-bank/knowledge/conventions.md`.
